# Memory Game Project

## Context

This is an exercise done in the context of the Front-end nanodegree from [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com).

## Playing

The player selects a level (that changes the number of pairs to be matched in order to win) and starts the game. Then the player must pair all the cards. At each round, 2 cards may be turned. If they match, their image will remain visible. If they don't, they turn again to hide.
The user wins when all cards are matched and displayed with their faces up. A modal is then displayed with congratulations, a quality rating and and an offer play again.
